# **Salyte - A Performance-Oriented Social Network**

## **Problem Statement**
The evolution of social networks has seen a shift toward privacy, reduced digital profiling, and a focus on creating individualized projections in specific contexts. Platforms like Discord, X (formerly Twitter), Bluesky, and Instagram prioritize personal representation over exhaustive digital footprints. However, this trend faces challenges when combined with the rise of short-video platforms like TikTok, which leave hard digital imprints.

Modern social networks often suffer from:
- **Performance inefficiencies** due to reliance on large frameworks like React.
- **High DOM update frequencies** and excessive data loads.
- **Backend scalability and latency issues** caused by non-uniform architectural decisions.

**Salyte** addresses these issues by building a high-performance, privacy-centric social network optimized for speed, scalability, and user experience.

Salyte is a lightweight, performance-oriented social network for microblogging, multimedia sharing, and community-driven interactions. Key features include:
- A clean, fast-loading, and minimalistic user interface.
- Privacy-centric user profiles with customizable visibility settings.
- Advanced analytics for creators, running in parallel to avoid user-facing delays.
